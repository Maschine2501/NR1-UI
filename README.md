# NR1-UI
Im building a Network Hifi Receiver from scratch.
Main components are a RaspberryPi4 and an HiFi-Berry-Dac.
An old Braun T2 Tuner serves as case for the player.
To keep as much as possible from the look of the device i needed an Interface for Volumio.
And especialy one that supports a 3,2" ssd1322 SPI Oled with 256x64Pixel.
After doing some research i found diehrdsk/Volumio-OledUI.
It fullfills many points on my "wishlist" but not nearly all.
As we all know, the way is the destination, i spent some time (much time....) in modifying the original code.

The project is not finished yet... but close the the goal!

I try to assist you, if you got questions or even problems with the code, just contact me.

Time by time more informations in the [wiki](https://github.com/Maschine2501/NR1-UI/wiki) will follow...

## The Code is now modular:

### To change the look/layout just press Button-C in "Standby-Screen" (Clock), select the desired Layout with the Rotary-Rotation and push the Rotary once to apply selection ->

## [Features](https://github.com/Maschine2501/NR1-UI/wiki/Features)

## To-Do: 
---
- [ ] Tune the whole UI (fonts, positions... etc.)
- [ ] Add RS232 -> Braun Master Control communication
- [ ] Make versions for other displays? like ssd1351, ssd1309? Maybe...
- [ ] More Layouts and redesigning the existing ones
- [ ] Make an un-installer Script...
- [ ] Make an Volumio-Plugin for NR1-UI
- [ ] Re-implement a second Rotary for Volume Control (selectable in Installation Config Menu)
